    <h1>From Garden to Plate</h1>
    <p>
      A <em>potager</em> is a French term to an ornament vegetable or kitchen
      garden. Often flowers &lpar;editble and non-edible&rpar; and herbs are
      planted with the vegetables to enhance the garden&apos; beauty. The goal
      is to make the function of providing food aesthetically pleasing.
    </p>

    <h2>What to Plant</h2>
    <p>
      Plants are chosen as much for their functionality as for color and form.
      Many are trained to grow upward. A well-designed potager can provide food,
      cut flowers and herbs for the home with very little maintenance. Potagers
      can disguise their functionality of providing for a home in a wide array
      of forms - from the carefree style of the cottage garden to the formality
      of a knot garden.
